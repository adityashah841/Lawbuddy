Authentication of electronic records. \u2013(1) Subject to the provisions of this section any subscriber \nmay authenticate an electronic record by affixing his digital signature.  \n(2) The authentication of the electronic record shall be ef fected by the use of asymmetric crypto \nsystem and hash function which envelop and transform the initial electronic record into another electronic \nrecord.  \nExplanation .\u2013For the purposes of this sub -section, \u2015hash function \u2016 means an algorithm mapping or \ntranslation of one sequence of bits into another, generally smaller, set known as \u2015hash result \u2016 such that an \nelectronic record yields the same hash result every time the algorithm is executed with the same electronic \nrecord a s its input making  it computationally infeasible \u2013 \n(a) to derive or reconstruct the original electronic record from the hash result produced by the \nalgorithm;  \n(b) that two electronic records can produce the same hash result using the algorithm.", "metadata": {"source": "data/IT_Act_2000_Updated.pdf", "page": 7}}}
