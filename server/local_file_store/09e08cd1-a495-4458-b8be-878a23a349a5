This perspective sees inequalities of power and economic wealth as having their roots in \nthe nature of the capitalist economic system. Conflict is therefore seen as inevit able and trade \nunions are a natural response of workers to their exploitation by capital. Whilst there may be \nperiods of acquiescence, the Marxist view would be that institutions of joint regulation would \nenhance rather than limit management's position as they presume the continuation of capitalism \nrather than challenge it. There are two variants of this view - the pessimist view propounded by \nLenin, Trotsky and Michel and the optimist view propounded by Marx and Engels.", "metadata": {"source": "data/Labour_Law.pdf", "page": 169}}}
