B, in consequence of the unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of \nknowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of  A's \ninstigation. B has committed no o ffence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling -house, and is liable to \nthe punishment provided for that offence.  \n(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z's possession. A \ninduces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's \nproperty. B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit thef t. But A is guilty of \nabetting theft, and is liable to the same punishme nt as if B had committed theft.", "metadata": {"source": "data/Indian_Penal_Code.pdf", "page": 30}}}
