This Bill, while being mindful of the fact that freedom of speech is a fundamental\nright recognises that free speech amounting to abuse interferes with the fundamental rightto freedom of speech for others. Persistent abuse and creation of insecurity causes actionablewrongs not only against the individual but leads to deterioration of public order. The needis to ensure that attempts to silence women are adequately punished. Further, an effectiveand easy mechanism has to be available to women to ensure that offensive material isscrubbed quickly and effectively from the internet. Mere punishment of the offender doesnot protect the victim who may be subject to distress due to the continued existence ortransmission of abusive material against her.
